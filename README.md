# COVID-19 & Happiness Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project is part of **Module 12: Real-World Data Analysis**. It combines data from two public sources:
- **COVID-19 Dataset**: Provides information on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries by country and date.
- **Worldwide Happiness Report**: Includes indicators such as happiness score, GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, and more.

The goal is to explore global trends and derive insights by analyzing the relationship between the pandemic's impact and national well-being indicators.

## Objectives

- Load, clean, and explore both datasets.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create insightful visualizations.
- Merge datasets based on country and analyze correlations between COVID-19 outcomes and happiness factors.
- Answer key research questions like:
  - Did happier countries fare better during COVID-19?
  - What role did GDP, health, and social support play in pandemic resilience?

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly (optional)

## Key Findings

- Countries with higher **GDP per capita**, **life expectancy**, and **social support** generally had better outcomes in terms of lower deaths per capita.
- While **happiness score** alone didn't strongly predict COVID-19 severity, related factors like **healthcare** and **support systems** did show moderate correlation.
- Countries with better infrastructure and trust in institutions had more stable outcomes.
